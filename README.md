# The WYSI Calculator for osu!
The easier way to get the WYSI badge!

# How to use?
1. Download and run the script.
2. When it asks you to `Enter the path to the difficulty file` either type out the path to the difficulty file located in your osu folder or just drag-and-drop it! (ex. `E:\Games\osu!\Songs\292301 xi - Blue Zenith\xi - Blue Zenith (Asphyxia) [FOUR DIMENSIONS].osu`).
3. Look at the numbers.
4. Using an overlay like **osu!StreamCompanion** when playing a level track your numbers. (Use `NF (No Fail)`)
5. When you reach the provided numbers, just stop playing and let you get those misses.
6. In the end you should have the accuracy you went for if you did everything right! **WYSI!**

**TODO:** GIFs or a video to show how to use it.
